  abstract  = {High dimensionality would be one of the major challenges faced by people working in research with big data as a high dimensionality that happens, while a dataset comprises of a big number of features. For resolving this issue, often researchers make use of a feature selection step for identification and removal of irrelevant features and repetitive features. Acceleration Artificial Bee Colony-Artificial Neural Network (AABC-ANN) has been introduced in the preceding research for handling the feature selection process over the big data. Computational complexity and inaccuracy of dataset remain as a problem for these methods. Enhanced Particle Swarm Optimization with Genetic Algorithm – Modified Artificial Neural Network (EPSOGA–MANN) is described in the proposed methodology for avoiding the above-mentioned issues. Modules including preprocessing, feature selection, and classification have been included in this research process. Fuzzy C Means (FCM) denotes the clustering algorithm which is used to handle the noise information efficiently in preprocessing. Feature selection process is carried out by means of EPSOGA algorithm optimally in this research. More important and relevant features are selected by EPSOGA optimization algorithm and as a result more accurate classification results are achieved in this work for huge volume of dataset. Input, hidden, and output layers are the three layers of MANN. It is introduced for improving the time complexity by means of neurons. The performance evaluation of the research method is conducted in the Matlab simulation environment.},

  abstract  = {Artificial neural networks (ANN) have been applied effectively in numerous fields for the aim of prediction, knowledge discovery, classification, time series analysis, modeling, etc. ANN training can be assorted into Supervised learning, Reinforcement learning and Unsupervised learning. There are some limitations using supervised learning. These limitations can be overcome by using unsupervised learning technique. This gives us motivation to write a review on unsupervised learning based on ANN. One main problem associated with unsupervised learning is how to find the hidden structures in unlabeled data. This paper reviews on the training/learning of unsupervised learning based on artificial neural network. It provides a description of the methods of selecting and fixing a number of hidden nodes in an unsupervised learning environment based on ANN. Moreover, the status, benefits and challenges of unsupervised learning are also summarized.},

@article{Gaudreault2021,
  abstract  = {Numerous machine learning applications involve dealing with imbalanced domains, where the learning focus is on the least frequent classes. This imbalance introduces new challenges for both the performance assessment of these models and their predictive modeling. While several performance metrics have been established as baselines in balanced domains, some cannot be applied to the imbalanced case since the use of the majority class in the metric could lead to a misleading evaluation of performance. Other metrics, such as the area under the precision-recall curve, have been demonstrated to be more appropriate for imbalance domains due to their focus on class-specific performance. There are, however, many proposed implementations for this particular metric, which could potentially lead to different conclusions depending on the one used. In this research, we carry out an experimental study to better understand these issues and aim at providing a set of recommendations by studying the impact of using different metrics and different implementations of the same metric under multiple imbalance settings.},

  abstract  = {Although few performance evaluation instruments have been used conventionally in different machine learning-based classification problem domains, there are numerous ones defined in the literature. This study reviews and describes performance instruments via formally defined novel concepts and clarifies the terminology. The study first highlights the issues in performance evaluation via a survey of 78 mobile-malware classification studies and reviews terminology. Based on three research questions, it proposes novel concepts to identify characteristics, similarities, and differences of instruments that are categorized into ‘performance measures’ and ‘performance metrics’ in the classification context for the first time. The concepts reflecting the intrinsic properties of instruments such as canonical form, geometry, duality, complementation, dependency, and leveling, aim to reveal similarities and differences of numerous instruments, such as redundancy and ground-truth versus prediction focuses. As an application of knowledge representation, we introduced a new exploratory table called PToPI (Periodic Table of Performance Instruments) for 29 measures and 28 metrics (69 instruments including variant and parametric ones). Visualizing proposed concepts, PToPI provides a new relational structure for the instruments including graphical, probabilistic, and entropic ones to see their properties and dependencies all in one place. Applications of the exploratory table in six examples from different domains in the literature have shown that PToPI aids overall instrument analysis and selection of the proper performance metrics according to the specific requirements of a classification problem. We expect that the proposed concepts and PToPI will help researchers comprehend and use the instruments and follow a systematic approach to classification performance evaluation and publication.},

@article{Ferri2009,
  abstract  = {Performance metrics in classification are fundamental in assessing the quality of learning methods and learned models. However, many different measures have been defined in the literature with the aim of making better choices in general or for a specific application area. Choices made by one metric are claimed to be different from choices made by other metrics. In this work, we analyse experimentally the behaviour of 18 different performance metrics in several scenarios, identifying clusters and relationships between measures. We also perform a sensitivity analysis for all of them in terms of several traits: class threshold choice, separability/ranking quality, calibration performance and sensitivity to changes in prior class distribution. From the definitions and experiments, we make a comprehensive analysis of the relationships between metrics, and a taxonomy and arrangement of them according to the previous traits. This can be useful for choosing the most adequate measure (or set of measures) for a specific application. Additionally, the study also highlights some niches in which new measures might be defined and also shows that some supposedly innovative measures make the same choices (or almost) as existing ones. Finally, this work can also be used as a reference for comparing experimental results in pattern recognition and machine learning literature, when using different measures.},
